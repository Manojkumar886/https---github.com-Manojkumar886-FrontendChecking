        Namakkal is located at 11.23°N 78.17°E. It has an average elevation of 218 metres or 715 feet. It is close to Kolli Hills – which are part of the Eastern Ghats. The closest significant river is the Kaveri and it is located 360 kilometres or 224 miles southwest of Chennai and 250 kilometres or 155 miles south of Bangalore.

Tourism in the district of Namakkal is based on the temples namely Namakkal anjaneyar temple[14] and Namagiri amman temple[15] of the area. The Kolli Hills, an outlier of the Eastern Ghats, constitute a prominent mountain range 45 kilometres (28 mi) away from Namakkal. It is eighteen miles or twenty eight kilometers long (from north to south), twelve miles or nineteen kilometers wide (from east to west) and the Koll block is spread over an area of 441.4 square kilometers. When viewed from the plains of the Namakkal district, the mountain looks like a flat-topped mass. The mountain has been inhabited from prehistoric times. It is much celebrated in the Tamil Literature of the Sangam Age and at least eleven poets describe about it in their poems. A Shiva Temple, known as the Arappalleeswarar Temple, dates back to twelfth century and is located at Periakoviloor near the waterfalls called Akasa Gangai. An ancient and powerful deity called Kolli Paavai of Ettukkai Amman is also at the Kolli Hills. It attracts large pilgrims and was originally a Jain retreat.
